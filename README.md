# voltera
This repository documents my work with the Voltera V-one printer: print characteristics (bandwidth testing, crosstalk etc.) and some applications that I have worked on with Professor Antonio Liscidini. This is an undergraduate first year research opportunity, working not only with Professor Liscidini, but also a few graduate students in his lab.

Please go to the wiki section for a full understanding of the project!
